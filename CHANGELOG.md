# Changelog

## 0.2.0 (2026-10-25)
- `Updates/`: GitHub-release update checker and update sheet, moved from
  AppSettings2Blueprint (the most recent copy). Each app passes an
  `UpdateConfiguration` with its GitHub repository and display name; the
  `UserDefaults` keys default to the names all apps already use, so saved
  preferences keep working. The sheet is macOS-only.
- `JTKitTestSupport`: `MockURLProtocol` and request/response helpers for
  network tests without real network calls.

## 0.1.0 (2026-10-25)
- Initial package scaffold. No shared components yet.
